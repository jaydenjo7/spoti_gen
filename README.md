# Spotigen

# Introduction
This is a Full-Stack project I made called Spotigen. I used React for the frontend, NodeJs (Express) for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. The idea behind Spotigen is that a user has a selection of five genres of music, those being Hip-Hop, Classical, Rock, Jazz, and Pop. Of these five genres, the user can select three and hit the "Generate Playlist" button, and just like that, Spotigen displays a link to your newly created playlist of 30 random songs of the genres you chose ready for listening in your Spotify account!
